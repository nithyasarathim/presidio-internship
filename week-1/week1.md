## Git/GitHub Workflow

### 1. Creating a Repository
- A **repository** (or "repo") stores **project files** and their **history**, created either **locally** or on a **hosting service** like **GitHub**.
- **Local**:
  - Navigate to your **project folder** in the **terminal**.
  - Run `git init` to create a hidden `.git` folder that tracks **project history**.
- **Remote** (e.g., **GitHub**):
  - Visit the **GitHub website** and click **"New repository"**.
  - Assign a **name** and **create** the repository.
  - Link your **local folder** to the **remote repo** with:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <URL>
    git push -u origin main
    ```

### 2. Branching
- **Branching** allows work on **new features** or **bug fixes** without altering the **main codebase**. The **main branch** is the **stable**, production-ready version.
- Create a new **branch**:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <branch-name>
  ```
  - This **shortcut** creates and switches to the new **branch**.
- List all **branches**:
  ```bash
  git branch
  ```
- Switch between **branches**:
  ```bash
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```

### 3. Making Changes and Committing
- On your **branch**, make **changes** to files and **commit** logical chunks of work.
- **Stage** changes:
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
  - Stages all **changes** in the current directory, preparing them for **commit**.
- **Commit** changes:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Clear and concise message describing changes"
  ```
  - The **commit message** should explain the purpose of the changes.
- **Push** the branch to the **remote repository**:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin <branch-name>
  ```

### 4. Pull Requests (PRs)
- A **Pull Request (PR)** is a **formal request** to **merge** changes from one **branch** into another (typically **main**), facilitating **team collaboration** and **code review**.
- **Creating a PR**:
  - **Push** your branch to the **remote repository**.
  - On **GitHub**, a **prompt** will appear to create a **Pull Request** for the pushed branch.
- **PR Process**:
  - **Teammates** review the **code** and provide **feedback**.
  - **Automated tests** check for **errors**.
  - Approved changes are **merged** into the **main branch**.

### 5. Merging vs. Rebasing
- **Merging** and **rebasing** are methods to **integrate changes** between **branches**.
- **Merging**:
  - Combines **branches** with a **merge commit**, preserving the full **commit history**.
  - **Pros**: **Safe**, maintains historical context.
  - **Command**:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge <feature-branch>
    ```
- **Rebasing**:
  - **Replays** a branchâ€™s **commits** on top of another, creating a **linear history**.
  - **Pros**: Cleaner, **straight-line history** without **merge commits**.
  - **Cons**: Rewrites **commit history**, problematic for shared **branches**.
  - **Command**:
    ```bash
    git checkout <feature-branch>
    git rebase main
    ```

### 6. Resolving Merge Conflicts
- A **merge conflict** occurs when **Git** cannot automatically combine changes due to edits on the **same lines** in a **file**.
- **Conflict Markers**:
  ```bash
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  Your changes
  =======
  Other person's changes
  >>>>>>> <branch-name>
  ```
- **Resolution Steps**:
  - **Manually edit** the file to keep desired **changes** or combine both.
  - **Remove** conflict markers.
  - **Stage** the resolved file:
    ```bash
    git add <file-name>
    ```
  - **Commit** the merge:
    ```bash
    git commit
    ```
